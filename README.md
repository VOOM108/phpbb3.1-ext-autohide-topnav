# phpbb3.1-ext-autohide-topnav

phpBB 3.1 Extension 
Autohides the fixed topnav of Bootstrap phpBB Style (like Comboot) for 3.1 

The user gets to choose between fixed and autohiding topnav in the UCP (display settings)

Needs local copy of http://www.virtuosoft.eu/code/bootstrap-autohidingnavbar/

You need to point the script-include in the ext-template to that local copy and rename the styles-path to fit your theme-path. 

(Is based on https://github.com/Crizz0/phpbb-ext-maxwidth-switch - thanks for the help :)
